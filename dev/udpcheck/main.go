// Whether a relay's UDP answers, from wherever this is run.
//
// The control node checks relays by opening a TCP connection, which is the
// right check for the thing it decides — whether to offer a relay at all — and
// says nothing about the part that carries the call. Media is UDP, and UDP has
// no handshake: a port that is filtered and a port that is open both return
// silence. So silence has to be read against something that would have spoken,
// which is what the STUN probe port is for.
//
// Run it from more than one place, and expect the answers to differ. That is
// not noise; it is the measurement. This deployment has a relay whose UDP
// answers four times out of four from Singapore and zero times out of twelve
// from the control node — same port, same relay, same minute — because the
// control node sits on a residential line in Tokyo and that one path drops it.
// A fleet-wide conclusion drawn from one vantage point would have called that
// relay broken, and it is not: everybody who actually calls through it reaches
// it.
