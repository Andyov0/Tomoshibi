"""Direct against through Hong Kong, on the same machine at the same minute.

Written because a single reading said Los Angeles gained nothing from going
through Hong Kong, and that reading was taken at four in the morning. The paths
this fleet crosses are congested on somebody else's schedule, and the hour that
decides whether a detour is worth having is the hour it was not measured in.

The comparison is live rather than before-and-after. Two ports on the same
relay: one has a rule sending it through Hong Kong and one does not, so both
readings are taken through the same weather. A before-and-after separated by a
day compares two different afternoons and calls the difference a result.

Prints a line per round. Left running it is the record; the interesting column
is the ratio, and the interesting hour is whichever one it moves in.
