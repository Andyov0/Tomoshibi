# Make a machine's viahk mapping survive a reboot.
#
# The scripts set nftables rules at the moment they are run and nothing else.
# That is the whole of what was wrong: a mainland relay rebooted for a kernel
# upgrade or a power cut came back with no rules, its overseas traffic went back
# to 340 ms and started dropping packets, and every check stayed green — the
# machine is up, the signalling port answers, the media port answers, and the
# only symptom is that people say the meeting is bad today. The measured 7.9x
# improvement is undone by one reboot and nothing anywhere says so.
#
# So the arguments are written down and replayed at boot. A unit rather than an
# @reboot cron line, because a unit can say it needs the network first and
# because `systemctl status viahk` is where somebody will look.
#
#   viahk-install.sh spoke <hub-ip> <dest-ip>:<dest-port>:<hub-port> ...
#   viahk-install.sh hub <hub-port>:<dest-ip>:<dest-port> ...
#   viahk-install.sh show
#   viahk-install.sh off
#
# Both roles can be installed on one machine, and one of them is: Shanghai
# Tencent sends its own overseas traffic through Hong Kong and carries Hong
# Kong's Shanghai Telecom traffic the last six milliseconds. The two scripts own
# different chains of the same table — output and postrouting against prerouting
# and hubpost — so each can be rebuilt without flushing the other's rules out
# from under it. Installing one role leaves the other's arguments alone.
#
# The arguments are exactly the ones the underlying script takes, and they are
# applied now as well as at boot, so this replaces running it by hand rather
# than being a second step after it.
