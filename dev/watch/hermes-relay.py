"""Take a line of text on the private network and put it in front of a person.

Runs on the Hermes machine, which is where the bot already lives, and speaks as
that bot to the channel it already uses. The control node does not get a copy of
the token: it posts text here and this posts to Telegram, so the token stays on
the one machine that had it, and a control node somebody takes is one that can
send messages rather than one that hands over the ability to speak as the bot.

Reads Hermes's own .env. An earlier version of this read a different project's
alert file that happened to sit on the same machine, which would have made this
deployment's alerts depend on a credential belonging to something else — and
put them in front of whoever that project had decided to tell.

Bound to the private address only. The two machines share 114.51.4.0/24 and
nothing else reaches it; a listener on the public address would be an
unauthenticated way to make the bot say anything.

The recipient comes from Hermes's configuration and never from the request. An
alert carries what is wrong and where to look at it, so being able to name its
own destination would make it a way to have the bot say anything to anybody.
