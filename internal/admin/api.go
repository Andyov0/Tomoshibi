// deployment that used one verb for both would have an operator ending a call
// while trying to tidy a list.
//
// What it is for is the placement. A name carries where an operator said it
// goes, and that now stands until somebody says otherwise — so a name used once
// for a test keeps a machine assigned to it until it ages out, and there was no
// way to be rid of it except waiting. Clearing the placement alone is the other
