/*
What an administrator did, and where it is written down.

For a long time this held two records of the same thing: five hundred entries in
memory for a page to show, and a line in the process log. The page was removed,
and what it was showing turns out to be the half that mattered less. A buffer in
the process being audited is readable exactly when that process is answering
requests — which is to say, never at the moment somebody most wants it, and the
management pages that displayed it are behind the same door as everything else.
The process log survives a restart, can be read over ssh with the service down,
and can be shipped somewhere the holder of this server cannot reach.

So there is one record now, and it is the durable one.
