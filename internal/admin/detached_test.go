/*
A control node has no media server, and these pages are entirely about one.

Every endpoint below dereferenced it unconditionally until a test stood one up
without one and watched the process panic. That is the shape of this fault: not
a wrong answer but a crash, on a machine whose whole job is to keep serving the
page while the media happens elsewhere, and reachable by an administrator doing
nothing more unusual than opening the dashboard.

So these ask for a management surface with no media behind it and require an
answer rather than a fall. 503 and not 404: the endpoint exists and the
deployment is configured for it, and what is absent is the thing it reports on.
