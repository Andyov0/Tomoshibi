/*
Bringing a relay up by hand is five things that must agree: the binary, the
deployment's credentials, the redis address, the certificate, and a DNS name
pointing at the machine. Getting any one wrong produces a relay that starts
cleanly and fails in a way that looks like something else — the wrong secret
answers 401 to every join, no redis makes an island whose calls cannot hear the
others, and a name that does not resolve is refused by browsers with nothing in
the relay's own log to say why.

So all five are done by the machine itself, from a script, against the control
node that already holds every one of them. What somebody types is a prefix.

The secret in that script is the whole of the security here, and what it buys is
the credential every relay signs with. The script is therefore not a public
document: it is fetched from the management pages by somebody signed in, and
anybody holding a copy can enrol a relay into this deployment. That trade is
made deliberately — the alternative is a per-machine token that has to be
minted, carried, and pasted inside its lifetime, which is the ceremony this
exists to remove.
