// installTemplate is the script a new relay runs.
//
// Written for /bin/sh, because a machine minutes into its life may have nothing
// else, and with every step visible because anybody about to run this as root
// should be able to read all of it.
//
// Held as a template rather than served from a file so that a relay's install
// cannot be broken by a file that failed to deploy alongside the binary — which
// is the one failure this whole path exists to remove.
//
// The %% sequences are printf escapes: this string is filled in by Fprintf with
// the deployment's own values, and everything the shell should see as a literal
// percent is doubled.

# Add this machine to the meeting deployment as a relay.
#
# One command on a fresh machine, and this does the five things that otherwise
# have to agree by hand: fetch the binary, claim the deployment's credentials
# and certificate, write the configuration, point a DNS name at this machine,
# and start the service.
#
#     bash <(curl -fLSs https://example/install) <prefix> <secret>
#
# The prefix may be left off, in which case it is asked for.
#
# The copy downloaded from the management pages carries the enrolment secret, and
# anybody holding that copy can add a relay to this deployment — treat it as the
# credential it is. The copy served at the public address carries none, and reads
# the secret from ENROL instead.

# below reads the rest of itself and the whole thing goes wrong in a way that
# looks like the prompt was skipped. This way stdin is still the terminal, which
# is what makes the interactive form work at all.
#
# The secret falls back to what was built in. The copy downloaded from the
# management pages has it, because those are behind a session; the copy served
# at the public address does not, so it travels in the operator's own command
# and nothing that logs a URL ever sees it.
