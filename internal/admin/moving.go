/*
Moving a meeting, and moving one person into it a different way.

A meeting lives on exactly one machine. The media server binds a room to
whichever node opened it and forwards everybody else there, and there is no
migration in it: a call cannot be handed from one node to another while it is
running, by this server or by anybody.

So "switch the server" has two honest meanings and they are different actions,
which is why both are offered rather than one being quietly chosen. Setting where
the room is held applies to the next call under that name and leaves the one in
progress alone — the right answer for a recurring meeting somebody wants held
somewhere better next time. Moving it now ends the call so everybody comes back,
and they come back to the machine that was chosen; that is disruptive and is said
so on the page, because a control that ends a meeting must not be pressed by
somebody who thought it would not.

Moving one person is the smaller of the two and, with forwarding, a real thing:
which relay somebody enters through is theirs alone, separate from where the room
is. It cannot be changed underneath them — a browser holds its connection to the
machine it dialled, and nothing in the protocol asks it to move. What can be done
is to record where they should come in next time and let go of them, which is
being removed with a reason. Said plainly rather than dressed up.

	// still exists.
	//
	// Told rather than guaranteed. The message is lossy on purpose: a reliable
	// one would be retried into a room that is about to stop existing, and the

	//
	// The order is the whole of it, and the first two attempts got it wrong in
	// opposite directions.
	//
	// Closing a room destroys it everywhere. The next person to connect creates
	// it again, on whichever node their own entry relay hands them to — so the
	// meeting landed wherever whoever reconnected fastest happened to be, while
	// the record said the machine the operator had chosen. A control that
	// reports success and does nothing is worse than one that fails.
	//
	// Putting the room up on the target first does not fix that, because the
	// close that follows takes down the room that was just put up: `Close` is by
	// name and reaches every node, including the one being moved to. That is
	// what shipped, and it looked exactly like the original fault, because it
	// was the original fault.
	//
	// So the empty room is created after the close, and it is what everybody
	// rejoins into. A room that already exists is not created again, and the
	// node it exists on is the one it was pinned to.
	//
	// The gap between destroying and recreating is two calls in one handler,
	// against a browser that has to notice it was disconnected before it can
	// try again. Should one ever win that race, the placement written down a
	// moment ago still sends it to the right entry, which is where this stood
