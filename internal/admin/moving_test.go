/*
 * Moving somebody to another machine, and what they are told about it.
 *
 * There is no message in the protocol that asks a browser to move: it holds a
 * connection to the machine it dialled, and the only way somebody comes in
 * through a different door is by coming in again. So a person is moved by being
 * let go of — which is the same thing a host does to throw somebody out, and
 * produces the same disconnection code.
 *
 * Before this they were told nothing else, so an operator putting one person on
 * a healthier relay sent them a notice saying they had been removed from the
 * meeting, and a call that did not come back.
 *
 * The warning has to be addressed to them rather than said to the room, and
 * that is what this file is mostly about. A message on this topic arms a tab to
 * rejoin after the next disconnection; broadcast, it arms every tab in the
 * room, and the next time a host legitimately ended the meeting all of them
 * would quietly rebuild it. That fault has happened once here already, from the
 * other direction, and it is the reason Tell exists at all.

/*
 * A move that moves the room, rather than closing it and hoping.
 *
 * Rooms here are never created deliberately: the first person to connect makes
 * one, on whichever node the media server picks for the machine they dialled.
 * So closing a room and letting everybody reconnect creates it again wherever
 * whoever got back first happened to be — and the record said the machine the
 * operator chose, while the meeting was somewhere else entirely.
 *
 * That is a control which reports success and does nothing, and it is what
 * "moving the room in the panel does not work" was.
 *
 * The order settles it, and this test exists because the first order tried was
 * the wrong one. Putting the room up on the target *before* closing looks right
 * and is not: closing is by name and reaches every node, so it takes down the
 * room that was just put up, and the move falls straight back into the race.
 * That version shipped and reproduced the original fault exactly.
 *
 * Close, then create the empty room pinned to the chosen node. Everybody who
 * reconnects finds a room that is already there, and a room that already exists
 * is not created a second time somewhere else.
