A restart used to sign everybody out.

Sessions were held in memory and nowhere else, on the reasoning that one should
not outlive the configuration that authorised it. That was true while the
administrators lived in a file and changing them meant a restart. Once the list
moved into the store it stopped being true — removing somebody takes effect on
the next request — and all the behaviour did was throw everybody out whenever
the process was upgraded, which during an afternoon of deployments is every few
minutes and reads as the sign-in being broken.
