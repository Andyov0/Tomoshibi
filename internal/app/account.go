The page somebody signs into to look after their own account.

Deliberately not the management pages. What somebody does here is change their
own passphrase and their own picture, and nothing else — no relay, no room, no
setting that belongs to the deployment. Putting the two behind one door would
mean everybody with an account holding a key to a building they have no business
in, and dressing the door differently for different people is how a page comes
to be one mistake away from showing the wrong person the wrong thing.

Recognised the same way everybody here is recognised: a name and a passphrase,
turned into a signature and compared against what was stored. This server has
never been told a passphrase in a form it keeps and still is not.
