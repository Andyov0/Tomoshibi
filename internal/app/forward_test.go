/*
Whether picking a server does anything for the second person into a room.

For the first person it always did: an empty name is opened wherever they are
sent. For everybody after them it did nothing at all, and the reason is that a
meeting lives on one node — the media server binds a room to whoever opened it
and forwards the rest. This server used to settle that by discarding the choice
and sending them to the holder, which is defensible and was also the reason a
relay bought for the route into it could sit for a month carrying no calls.

So the choice is kept and the media is forwarded through it. That turns one
decision into three, and each of them is a way for this to be quietly wrong:

  - the client must still dial the relay it picked, or forwarding has nothing to
    forward through;
  - it must be given credentials for that relay and not for the holder, which is
    the mistake that reads correctly in a diff and fails only in a call;
  - a relay that will not forward must send them to the holder instead, because
    a client pointed at a TURN server that is not there gathers no candidates at
    all and never connects — worse than the behaviour this replaced.

The room record is the fixture here. It is what says where a meeting already is,
and every case below is really a question about what this server does with it.

would be turned away from starting a room while signed in, known to this server

The refusal is also silent in the useful sense — it arrives as a 403 on a name

Two relays that must not carry each other's calls.

Reachability between two machines is a fact about the networks between them and
nothing here can derive it: two relays can both be fast, both be in the same
country, both answer every probe, and still carry nothing usable between each
other. So the pairs that are no good are written down by whoever found out.

It is worth a test rather than a comment because it is invisible when wrong. The
call still connects; it just goes the long way through a path that does not work,
and the only symptom is somebody saying the meeting was bad — which reads as the
relay they picked being bad rather than as a pair that should never have formed.

The symmetry is the part that would rot. Written on one side of the comparison
only, the pair would forward or not depending on which end a client happened to
come in at, and every test of the remembered half would pass.

A machine that can carry a call the picked one cannot.

The fleet has machines on both sides of a border and nothing abroad can usefully
carry media to anything inside it. Without a way round that, choosing a server
abroad and joining a meeting held inside gets the behaviour forwarding replaced —
a direct connection across the border, which is the thing every relay here exists
to avoid. One machine can talk to both sides, so somebody who lands on a pair
that will not work is sent to that one instead.

Sent, rather than left where they were with their media routed elsewhere. That is
the part worth a test: the entry has to change, or the panel says one machine, the
packets go through another, and nothing anywhere reconciles them.

It is symmetrical, and that is not an accident of the code — it falls out of
asking whether the pair works rather than which side anybody is on. Somebody
inside joining a meeting held abroad hits exactly the same case, and a guard
written for one direction would leave the other going direct.

And a bridge is not a wildcard. It stands in only where it is itself usable: a
bridge kept apart from the room's own machine is no more use than the entry that
could not reach it, which is the case that decides whether "route everything
through the one that works" quietly becomes "route everything through the one
that does not".
