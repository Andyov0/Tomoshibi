/*
The person a room answers to.

Every meeting eventually needs somebody who can quiet it. Not moderation in the
management sense — that belongs to whoever runs the deployment and is behind a
different door — but the ordinary business of a call: a microphone left open in a
noisy room, somebody who will not leave, a meeting whose owner has gone home and
handed it on.

Until now the only person who could do any of that was an administrator of the
whole deployment, which is the wrong shape twice over. It gives somebody running
one meeting nothing, and it means the only way to give them something is to hand
them every room, every relay and every account.

So the room has a host: whoever first spoke its name, because there is nobody
else it could reasonably be, and transferable, because the person who opened a
recurring meeting is not always the person running it. An administrator is a host
everywhere, which is not a special case so much as what being an administrator
already meant.

Proof is the token. There are no sessions for people in a call — a join is
stateless and deliberately so — but the token this server signed for them names
one room and one identity and cannot be edited, which is exactly the claim these
requests need. Sending a passphrase back would be the alternative and a bad one:
it would put a credential on the wire for every mute.
