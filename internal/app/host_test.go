/*
Who may act on a room, and with what.

There are no sessions for people in a call, so the token this server signed is
the whole of the proof: it names one room and one identity and cannot be edited.
Everything below is a way of getting that wrong.

The one that would not look wrong in a diff is the room. The path names a room
and so does the grant, and using the path is the natural thing to write — it is
right there, it is a string, and every request where the two agree passes. The
requests where they disagree are the attack: a token for a meeting somebody was
invited to, replayed against a meeting they were not, muting whoever they like.

The rest are the ordinary ones. A guest is not the host. A host of one room is
not the host of another. And a room whose record predates hosts answers to
nobody, which must not be read as answering to everybody — that would make the
first person to ask the host of every old room on the deployment.

An invite that is dead the moment it is made.

The link is created by somebody sitting in the meeting, sent to somebody else,

at the instant the link is read gets all three of those wrong: a room only exists
there while somebody is connected to it, so there is no room to find between the
host pressing start and their browser finishing its handshake, none between the
last person leaving and the next arriving, and none at all for a meeting arranged
in advance.

The symptom is the worst kind — the link works when the person who made it tries
it, because they are connected, and reports that the meeting is over to everybody
they sent it to.

What ends a link is the room being closed, which throws the links away with it,
and the ceiling on the invite itself. Both are things somebody did or a clock
