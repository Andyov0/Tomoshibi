/*
Being let into one meeting without being given anything else.

The two ways in are otherwise both about knowing something: a passphrase, or a
room name nobody has told anybody else. Neither suits somebody invited to a
single call. A passphrase is an account. And a room name is worse than it looks —
a room here is a name and nothing else, so handing over the name of a recurring
meeting hands over every future instance of it, for good, to whoever the link
reaches after them.

An invite carries neither. It names one room, it stops working, and whoever
redeems it gets an issued mark: a signature drawn from nothing, which says only
that they are not the other people in the call. That is the honest description of
a guest and it is all that should be claimed for one.

How many people it admits is however many are sent it, and how long it lasts is
until the meeting ends or a day, whichever comes first.

Not one person, which is what this said and what half an implementation of it is
still visible in the store. The panel that mints these offers a link and a way to
stop it working, and describes it as one anybody may use — a host inviting three
people should press the button once, and a link that stopped working after the
first of them arrived would read as broken. Being able to take it back is what
makes that safe, and that is what the revoke is for.

The day is the ceiling under the real rule rather than the rule: a link found in
a message from March should be dead however the asking went.

A room held under a scope keeps all of this for a link made in a call, and adds
a standing invitation, which a member makes on their own page for people who
come back. That kind carries a name and a window instead of a day, lasts until
revoked when nobody gave it an end, and survives the meeting being ended. See
standingInvite, and the store's header for the rest of the argument.

// The ceiling on an invite, which is not the rule.

// from March should be dead however the asking went.

/*
standingInvite reads whether a link into a scoped room is to be a standing
invitation and, where it is, what it is for: whose name it lets somebody wear,
when it opens, and when it stops.

Asked for by name rather than inferred from a body being there. An ordinary
link is what a press in a call makes, and a request that grew a body for some
other reason must not quietly become a link that outlives the meeting. Without
it nothing else in the body is read.

The three are optional. No end is a link that lasts until it is revoked, because
these are made on purpose for people who come back — a client's weekly call —
and a ceiling would be a link that dies on a schedule nobody chose. There is no
upper bound on the end either: the window is checked only at the door, and a
guest already in the call is never put out by it, so a long one gives nothing
away that an unbounded one would not.

Times arrive as instants with their zone, as an arrangement's does, because a
time with no zone is a time in a zone somebody guessed.

A name longer than a display name may be is refused rather than trimmed. The
join trims what a guest typed, because their intent is obvious; here the person
making the link is choosing what somebody else will be called, and a name that
saved shorter than it was typed is one they did not choose.
