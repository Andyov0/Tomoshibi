/*
Standing at the door of a meeting that will not have you.

The join refuses somebody with no invite, no account and no claim on the room,
and that is the right answer to a stranger who guessed a name. It is the wrong
answer to somebody who was told "we're on at four" and never got the link,
which is most of the people who will ever hit it — the room is real, they are
expected, and the only thing they are missing is a URL somebody forgot to send.

So they can knock, and somebody in the room can answer. Admitting mints them an
invite and nothing else: the door already knows how to let in somebody holding
one, and a second way through it would be a second thing to keep correct.

What this does not do is tell the knocker anything. A refusal and a knock that
nobody answers look identical from outside, and a room that does not exist
looks like both — otherwise this would be a way to find out which names are in
use by knocking on them.
