Meetings arranged ahead of time.

The store file carries the argument for what an arrangement is; this file is
the door to it. Three things come through here: a host arranging one and being
handed the link, a person holding the link asking whether it has begun, and the
host's own join, which is what begins it.

## Who may arrange one

Somebody signed in. Not somebody with a passphrase in a field — the lobby is
where arranging is offered, the lobby is for accounts, and an account is a
signature this deployment already vouches for. The meeting's host is that
signature, which is also what the room recognises them by when they walk in.

Not on a name somebody else is already host of. Without that rule any account
could arrange a meeting on a room another person holds every day, walk in, and
be handed working invitations to it: the mint on beginning is keyed only to the
arrangement's host, and the arrangement would be theirs. The refusal is made at
the moment of arranging rather than at the meeting, when it can still be acted
on by picking another name.

Not where joining asks for an account. Under that policy an invitation is
ignored at the door, so everything this hands out would be refused, and the
kind thing is to say so before a link exists rather than to twenty people on
the day.

## What the link tells a stranger

The room's name, which is in the link already; when; where it is held, by a
relay name that is public anyway; and whether it has begun. The last is a
presence signal — somebody holding the link can tell when the host is in the
room — and that is accepted: the link is sent to people the host means to have
in the room, and knowing the host has arrived is what they are waiting for.

The token itself cannot be enumerated: it is derived under a key from an id
minted from twenty-four random bytes.

arrangedPlacement is where a host's own arranged meeting is to be held, for
the join to honour before it picks anywhere else.

Only for the host, only inside the window, and only where the relay still
exists — a relay taken out of the fleet between arranging and meeting is not a
place anybody can be sent. Answers nothing for everybody else, and nothing once
the meeting has begun, because by then the placement has been written down
where every join reads it.

The join asks this whenever the room's record is not a deliberate placement,
and not only when it is empty. A record that holds a guess — the note every
join leaves for two hours — is exactly what the host's own camera test on the
name leaves behind, and an arrangement is an instruction where a guess is a
measurement; the first version asked only for an empty record, so the host's

beginArranged is the moment a meeting starts: its host has just joined.

Everything here is best effort and says so in the log, because the join has
already succeeded and nothing about an arrangement is allowed to turn a host's
own join into a refusal. Two things happen when a meeting actually begins:

The invitation is minted and kept, so the link can hand it out.

And the room's placement is written as a deliberate one, so every guest's join
reads it from the record — never asking the media server, never ageing out —
which is what makes the host's choice hold across a call that may not have a
single participant yet when the first guest's join arrives. Only where the host
chose a machine: a meeting arranged for wherever suits is not pinned to
wherever the first join happened to land.

Nothing here makes anybody the host. The first version did, unconditionally,
and that let any account take any room whose name had gone quiet: arrange a
meeting on it, walk in, and the room was theirs. The name is reserved for the
arranger while the meeting is pending instead (see reservedFor), so by the time
this runs the room's host is the arranger or nobody, and where it is somebody
else after all — an administrator opened it, say — the meeting does not begin
in their room.
