/*
Keeping a relay nobody can reach out of the choosing.

The browser measures every relay it is offered and names the fastest, and that
measurement cannot tell a relay that is there and refusing from one that is not
there at all. Both arrive as an error event with nothing readable on it —
deliberately, because a page that could tell the difference could map a network
it was never given. So the two are indistinguishable from the one place that
would most like to know.

Which would be a curiosity, except that it inverts. A relay refusing an
untokened upgrade has to complete a TLS handshake and answer an HTTP request
before it can refuse; a relay whose connection is reset answers in one round
trip and answers sooner. The broken one wins the measurement, wins the room, and
the call fails — and it wins by more the more thoroughly it is broken.

The control node has the answer the browser cannot get: it opens a TCP
connection to each relay and sees whether it completes. So the two are split.
This decides which relays are worth offering, and the browser decides which of
those is nearest.

Checked here on a ticker and not per request. Answering a join must not wait on
a network round trip to a machine in another country, and a list read by every
client on every join would otherwise become one connection per relay per join —
which is how the last measurement got a relay blocked.

// Slower than it could be. What this catches is a machine that has gone away,

// than none, and a great deal better than the reverse mistake.

// Generously long compared to any real answer — a TCP handshake across the

	// starts before the outage or ends after it, and some relays are checked
