Rooms held under a scope.

A scope is a label on accounts — a company, a team — and `standup@acme` is a room
only the people carrying `acme` may say. It is still a name and nothing else:
there is no room object, nothing created first, and nothing to clean up. What
the suffix changes is the question the join asks.

## Every time, not the first time

The door for a plain name is about opening it. Whoever first says a name decides
whether it may be opened, and after that anybody who knows it is in — which is a
fine model for a name that is long and given out carefully, and the wrong one
here. A scoped room asked only at its opening would let in anybody the name ever
reached once it had been used, and a guest's link puts the name in front of the
guest. So the scope is checked on every join: a member, an administrator, or
somebody holding a live invitation from one of those, and nobody else.

A link is worth its maker's standing, asked every time it is used: taking
somebody out of a scope takes their links with it, without anybody having to
find and revoke each one. It is asked just before the link is counted rather
than inside the same write, and the gap between the two is not worth closing —
a guest let in a moment before the tag went keeps their place for the whole
meeting anyway, because nothing puts out somebody already in the call.

The opening and joining policies do not apply. A scope is something an
administrator set up on purpose, so a room under one keeps its own rule and that
rule is the whole of it; mixing the two would leave a room whose door depends on
two settings in two places. A scoped name cannot be arranged in advance either,
because an arrangement reserves a name for its host and nothing here checks that
the host is a member.

## Nobody is the host, so everybody in it is

A scoped room has no recorded host. Every member, and every administrator who may
moderate, runs it: mutes, removes, ends the meeting, moves it, answers the door.
A recorded host was considered and is worse: `ClaimHost` only claims an empty
record, so a host taken out of the scope would leave the room answering to
somebody who may no longer enter it and to nobody else, for good. With no host
there is nothing to hand over, and the handover is refused.

## Closed when the store will not answer

The deployment's rule is the opposite one — a store that cannot tell an unused
name from one a meeting is happening in lets the join through and says so — and
this departs from it on purpose. That rule protects a first use: whoever it lets
through already knows the name. The scope protects every use, and a scoped room
that let people in while the store was down would be a meeting handed to anybody
who guessed its name for as long as the outage lasted. So the refusal stands,
and it is logged as an outage rather than said as a judgement about the person.

admitScoped decides whether somebody may enter a room held under a scope.

In order, and the order is the policy: an account session that carries the tag
or belongs to an administrator; then a live invitation to this room; then a
passphrase that carries the tag or is an administrator's. Nothing else gets in.
Answers the invitation that let them in, nil for a member, and false having
already written the refusal.

An invitation makes its holder a guest, whatever else they brought: the caller
mints their token from neither their passphrase nor their session. A member
who wants to be themselves opens the room by its name; a guest's link is for
the guest, and the name signed into their token is the one it was made for. The
session goes first all the same. Nobody is signed in by accident, and somebody
signed in to an account in the scope is that member; turning them into a
stranger in their own group's room because a link was in their address bar
would be the door being clever at them.

An invitation that is no good does not end the asking. It may be for another
room — the cookie a previous guest visit left is sent with every join — and a
member with their passphrase who happened to be holding one is still a member.
Only when nothing else admits them is its reason the answer, and only where
that reason is about this room: a link that ran out or has not opened yet says
so, and one that names another room says nothing about this one.

Whether the passphrase belongs to an administrator was settled by the caller,
charged against the guessing budget, and is not asked again here. Asking whether
it belongs to a member is not charged a second time either: the same passphrase
was charged once at the top of the join, and a guess is one guess however many
lists it is compared against.
