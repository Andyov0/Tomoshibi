/*
Which files a browser may keep, and for how long.

The rule is simple and was applied to one file instead of three. Assets are
named after their contents, so a changed asset is a changed URL and the old one
can be kept forever. A document's name never changes, so it must be revalidated
or a deployment reaches nobody who has visited before.

This deployment serves three documents. Only the client was named, so the
management and account pages went out as immutable for a year — and immutable is
not a cache that goes stale and recovers, it is a promise a browser takes at its
word and a CDN repeats per edge. The symptom is a fix that reaches some people
and not others, indefinitely, and looks exactly like a build that never
deployed.

Serving the copy that was compressed at build time.

One file needs this: MediaPipe's vision runtime, which background blur cannot
work without and which is nine megabytes uncompressed. The published copies are
on jsdelivr and Google's storage and neither answers from mainland China, so it
has to come from here, and here is a binary copied to every relay.

Only the compressed copy is stored. That makes two things load-bearing that
would otherwise be cosmetic, and both are asserted below.

The Content-Type has to come from the name that was asked for. Served under the
stored name a wasm file goes out as application/x-brotli or as nothing at all,
and WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming refuses it — as a corrupt module, which
says nothing about the cause.

And Vary has to be set, because a cache in front of this would otherwise hand
the compressed bytes to a client that did not ask for them.
