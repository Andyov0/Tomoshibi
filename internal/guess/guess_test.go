/*
The name is not decoration on the sign-in form.

Without it, every attempt is checked against every administrator at once, so a
list of leaked passphrases run at this endpoint succeeds if any one person on the
deployment has ever reused one — and it succeeds without the attacker having to
know that anybody exists. With it, a guess has to be aimed at somebody: one pool
becomes as many separate pools as there are administrators.

The compatibility case is the one that would rot quietly. An administrator with
no name recorded is matched by passphrase alone, because refusing them would lock
out any deployment upgrading into this — and a test that only covered the happy
path would let somebody later "tidy up" that branch and take the deployment with
it.
