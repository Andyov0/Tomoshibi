//
// Behind proxies it is read from the right, hops entries in, and never from the
// left. Each proxy appends the address it saw to whatever the header already
// said, and what it already said is the caller's to write, so the first entry is
// exactly as choosable as an untrusted header. This used to read the first
// entry, which let a script buy a fresh join budget and a fresh sign-in
// allowance per request, and put any address it liked beside its name.
//
// The count is configuration rather than a fixed "last entry" because the last
// entry is only the caller behind exactly one proxy. The deployment this fork
// was written for has a CDN in front of nginx; a request sent there with a
// forged header arrived as "forged, caller, CDN node", so the last entry is the
// node, and reading it would charge everybody the node serves as one caller --
// one person's typos locking a whole region out of signing in.
//
// Fewer entries than hops means the request came in past the outer proxies,
// and every entry it does carry was still written by one this deployment
// trusts, so the leftmost of them is the furthest out anybody vouches for.
