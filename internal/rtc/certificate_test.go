/*
The one path by which a relay's certificate is ever replaced.

Everything about this is quiet when it goes wrong. A push that is refused leaves
the relay serving a certificate that still works, for a while; a push that is
accepted when it should not have been leaves it serving one somebody else chose.
Neither shows up until a date that is months away, which is the whole reason the
fleet had no distribution at all until now: nothing about the missing one was
visible either.

The certificate two relays hold for their own bare address, and the wildcard
that ate it.

Those two are dialled by address rather than by name, because the name they used
to answer to is filtered on this path and the address is not. So each of them
issues its own certificate for that address — short-lived, six days, renewed
four times a day by its own cron — and that is the certificate they must serve.

The rule here used to be "a later expiry is a renewal", which is true of every
relay but those two and catastrophic for them: a ninety-day wildcard expires
later than a six-day address certificate by definition, so the fleet-wide push
replaced it. Both machines went on answering, and every client that checks the
name it dialled against the certificate it was given stopped being able to reach
them — which does not look like a certificate problem from the outside. It looks
like two relays that went quiet.
