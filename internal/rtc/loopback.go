/*
A control node that runs a relay beside it reaches that relay by the name it
publishes, which resolves to the machine's own public address — and on most
hosts a packet sent to your own public address does not come back. Some routers
do it, most do not, and a cloud network almost never does. The connection is not
refused; it is simply never answered, so every request waits out its timeout.

Nothing looks broken. The relay is up, the page eventually draws, and the
management surface merely takes six seconds a panel. The one deployment where
this was measured spent twelve seconds per call and answered 502 on the slowest
page, because nginx gave up first.

So a connection to an address this machine already holds is turned around at the
socket rather than sent to the network. The name is left alone, which matters:
the certificate is issued for it, and rewriting the URL to 127.0.0.1 would make
every one of these calls fail verification instead of merely being slow.
