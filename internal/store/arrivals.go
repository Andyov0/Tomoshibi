/*
What was seen of somebody at the door.

The media server knows who is in a room and what they are sending, and it does
not know either of the two things an operator asks first: where they came from,
and which machine they came in through. It cannot — by the time it sees them
they arrived over a signalling socket from a relay, and the relay is what it
would report.

This server saw both, once, at the join: the address the request came from, and
the machine it chose for them. Neither is recoverable afterwards, so it is
written down there and nowhere else.

Kept against the identity rather than the name. A name is typed and can be
anything; the identity is signed into the token and is the one field about a
participant that nobody, including them, can change afterwards — which is what
makes the row worth reading at all.

These expire. An arrival is a note about a call in progress and stops being true
the moment somebody leaves, and nothing tells this server when that happens: the
media server holds the room and this one is not in it. So they are swept on age
rather than on departure, and a row older than a long meeting is a row about
nobody.
