/*
A link that lets one person into one room, once, without a passphrase.

The two ways in here are otherwise both about knowing something: a passphrase, or
a name nobody has told anybody else. Neither suits somebody being invited to one
meeting — handing over a passphrase gives them the account, and handing over the
room name gives them every future meeting held under it, because a room here is a
name and nothing else.

So an invite is a third thing, and its whole value is in what it does not carry.
It names one room, it stops working, and it proves nothing about who redeems it:
whoever arrives gets an issued mark, which says only that they are not the other
people in the call. It is not a credential and it is not an identity, which is
exactly right for somebody who was sent a link.

It lasts as long as the meeting does, and that is the only limit worth having.
It was single use to begin with, on the reasoning that a link pasted into a group
chat should let in the person it was meant for and nobody else. That is a fine
rule for a link and a bad one for a meeting: the person it was meant for reloads,
their phone sleeps, they are asked to bring a colleague, and each of those is the
link failing at the only thing it is for. Worse, a host with six guests had to
mint six links and keep track of which had been spent.

So the meeting is the boundary. While the room is running the link works, for
whoever has it; when the room ends the link is worth nothing, and closing the room
throws the links away outright. What that gives away is that anybody the link
reaches during the meeting can join it — which is what a meeting link means
everywhere else, and what somebody pasting one into a group chat is doing on
purpose.

The ceiling below is a backstop, not the rule. It exists because "while the room
is running" is answered by asking the media server, and a link should not
outlive that conversation being possible.
