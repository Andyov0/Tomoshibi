/*
Meetings arranged before anybody is in them.

A room here is a name and nothing else, and that is still true: this does not
create a room, it writes down that somebody means to use a name at a time, on a
machine of their choosing, and mints the one thing another person needs in order
to be there.

## Why this is not an invitation with a date on it

An invitation is redeemed at the door and lets somebody in. Half the point of
arranging a meeting is that the person arriving early must *not* be let in, so
what the link carries is a way to ask "has it begun", and the invitation is
minted at the moment the answer becomes yes.

That also settles what an early arrival does with their time: everything except
join. They choose a camera, a microphone and a way in, and none of that touches
the room, because there is no room to touch.

## When it begins

When its host walks into the room, inside the window around the time it was
arranged for. Not on a button: a host who is in the room is hosting, and a gate
they had to press would leave everybody outside while they sat inside wondering
why nobody came — which is the fault the waiting room's notice was added for.

The window is the other half of that rule. A host who uses a name every day and
arranges Thursday's meeting on it must not begin Thursday's meeting on Monday,
hand its invitation to people who then arrive into Monday's call, and have that
invitation expire before Thursday comes. So a join begins a meeting only from an
hour before its time until a day after it, and outside that window an arranged
meeting is simply not there to begin.

Which is also why one name holds one pending meeting. A second, later
arrangement on the same name is refused rather than queued: at the door there
would be no telling which meeting a person had come for, and the window rule
would begin whichever one was nearest.

## The name is the host's while the meeting is pending

Between arranging and beginning, nobody but the arranger may open the name. Not
because a room is anything more than a name — it is not — but because the
alternative was worse in both directions. Let anybody open it and an early
guest with an account becomes its host by walking in first, and then either the
meeting cannot begin or the arranger has to take the room from them; taking it
was tried, and it let any account take any room whose name had gone quiet for
three days. Refusing the door to everybody else for the length of the
arrangement is the smaller rule, and the join says what it always says about a
name that is not open: ask the organiser for the link.

Arranging is offered in the lobby, and the lobby exists only where opening a
room asks for an account. A deployment that lets anybody open anything has no
lobby and no arranging, which is consistent: it has no accounts to be a host.

## Who may start one

The host, meaning whoever arranged it, identified the way everybody here is
identified — by the signature their passphrase makes. Not by a session, which
expires, and not by the link, which is the thing everybody else has.

A person who changes their passphrase changes their signature, and with it
loses the arrangements made under the old one; the same is already true of the
rooms they host. Recorded here rather than fixed, because a passphrase change
is rare and an arrangement is short-lived.

## The link is derived, not stored

The token in the link is an HMAC of the meeting's id under the deployment's
tripcode key, and the record is kept against the hash of that token exactly as
an invite is. So a host can be shown the link again from the id alone, and a
copy of the store still holds no link to any meeting. Storing the token in the
clear would have made the store worth a day's entry to every meeting in it,
which is more than the header on the invite field below concedes.

A day, because the failure this bounds is somebody arranging a meeting, nobody

A day is also longer than any meeting anybody has been late to, so the link a
person opens an hour afterwards still says what it was rather than nothing at
all.

Begin marks the meeting for a room as started, by its host.

Found by walking, because the key is the hash of a token the host does not have
in front of them — they have a room and a signature. There are never many of
these and they are swept, so a walk is cheaper than a second index that can
disagree with the first. The walk only reads; the write comes after it returns,
because a bucket must not be written from inside its own ForEach — bbolt calls
that undefined behaviour, and the rest of this store already goes to the same
trouble to avoid it.

Answers the meeting whether or not this call is what started it: a host whose
browser asks twice, or who rejoins, is not an error and must not read as one.

`invite` is the token to hand out from now on, and is written only by the call
that actually begins the meeting; a later call gets the one already written.
The caller can tell which happened by comparing, and only then stores the
invite proper — this cannot do that itself, because storing an invite is its
own transaction and a transaction inside a transaction is a deadlock in bolt.

A meeting outside its window answers ErrNoSuchMeeting rather than beginning,
which is the rule at the top of the file: a join on Monday is not Thursday's
