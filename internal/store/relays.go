// relaysBucket holds the media servers this deployment hands clients to.
//
// In the store rather than in the configuration file, for the reason
// rooms.opened_by is: a relay is added when a machine is brought up and removed
// when it is taken away, and both happen while the deployment is running.
// Editing a file and restarting to add one would drop every call in progress on
// the control node, which is a strange price for an operation that changes
// nothing about the calls already being held elsewhere.
//
// The configuration file remains the starting value, adopted the first time
// this runs, exactly as the opening policy is.
var relaysBucket = []byte("relays")

// Relay is one media server, as the deployment knows it.
type Relay struct {
	// Name identifies it: to an operator reading a log, and to a client naming
	// the one it measured as fastest. Immutable once created — a rename would
	// silently orphan every client that had measured the old one.
	Name string `json:"name"`

	// URL is the WebSocket origin a browser dials. Handed to clients verbatim.
	URL string `json:"url"`

	// Region is this deployment's own label for where the machine is. Compared
	// against a client's, never interpreted.
	Region string `json:"region,omitempty"`

	// Probe is where this relay answers STUN binding requests, as host:port.
	//
	// Sent to clients so the picker can time one round trip over UDP rather
	// than three over TLS. Empty where the relay does not answer, and a client
	// that is given nothing falls back to timing the signalling socket — which
	// is what it did before this existed and is still the honest ranking.
	Probe string `json:"probe,omitempty"`

	// Turn is where this relay forwards media, as host:port.
	//
	// A meeting lives on one node — the media server binds a room to whichever
	// node opened it — so without this, picking a server decided nothing for
	// anybody but the first person in: their signalling was forwarded to the
	// holding node and their media went straight past the machine they picked,
	// which carried none of the call it was chosen for.
	//
	// With it, a client that picked this relay allocates on its TURN server and
	// the packets are forwarded on. One extra hop, paid on purpose, in exchange
	// for the call entering the country the caller is in.
	//
	// Empty where the relay does not run one, and a relay that cannot forward is
	// not broken: a client that picks it while the room is elsewhere is sent
	// straight to the node holding the room, which is what everybody got before
	// this existed.
	Turn string `json:"turn,omitempty"`

	// Forwards is whether this relay may carry a call it is not holding.
	//
	// Separate from Turn, which is where, and deliberately separate from
	// AdminOnly, which is who: a machine can be reserved and still be the right
	// place to forward through, and a machine anybody may use can be one whose
	// bandwidth is too expensive to spend twice. Relaying costs the relay two
	// bytes for every one — in and out again — so this is the switch on the
	// bill, and it belongs to whoever pays it rather than being inferred.
	Forwards bool `json:"forwards,omitempty"`

	// Apart names the relays this one must not forward with.
	//
	// By name and in either direction: if either of a pair lists the other, the
	// pair does not forward, whichever end a client came in at. Symmetry is not
	// a convenience — a rule written on one side of a comparison is a rule on
	// neither, and the half that was forgotten is the half that produces the
	// outage.
	//
	// It exists because reachability between two machines is a fact about the
	// networks between them and nothing here can derive it. Two relays can both
	// be fast, both be in the same country, both answer every probe, and still
	// carry nothing usable between each other — and the only symptom of pairing
	// them is a call that stutters, which reads as the relay somebody picked
	// being bad rather than as a pair that should never have been formed.
	//
	// Deliberately not derived from the region. Region groups the picker for
	// people to read, and inferring a network rule from it means a change made
	// for legibility silently changes where media goes.
	Apart []string `json:"apart,omitempty"`

	// Bridge marks a relay that may stand in for one that cannot reach a room.
	//
	// The case it exists for: a fleet with machines on both sides of a border,
	// where nothing abroad can usefully carry media to anything inside it, but
	// one particular machine can talk to both. Somebody abroad joining a meeting
	// held inside is then sent to that machine instead of to the one they picked,
	// and their call goes in the one way it can rather than not at all.
	//
	// Standing in is not the same as being chosen. A bridge is used only where
	// the pair somebody actually landed on will not work, and it still has to be
	// a relay that pair may use — a bridge kept apart from the machine holding
	// the room is no more use than the entry was.
	Bridge bool `json:"bridge,omitempty"`

	// Lat and Lon are where the machine is, in degrees.
	//
	// For the globe on the join screen, and — since the media servers were told
	// to place rooms by distance — for the region list every one of them is
	// given. Nothing measures with them; they say where a machine is, and both
	// readers want that for their own reasons.
	//
	// A relay without them is simply not drawn, which is the honest thing to do
	// with a machine nobody has said the location of: guessing from a region
	// name would put a box in the middle of a country it is not in and look
	// exactly as authoritative as the ones that are right. It is also left out
	// of the region list, where a guess would be worse still — it would place
	// calls.
	Lat float64 `json:"lat,omitempty"`
	Lon float64 `json:"lon,omitempty"`

	// Node is what the media server on this machine calls the place it is in.
	//
	// Not Region, which is this deployment's own grouping and is shown to
	// people; this is an identifier the media servers compare against each
	// other, and the two want different things. "Oversea/Asia" groups four
	// machines usefully on a page and would collapse them into one place for
	// routing, which is the opposite of what the routing is for.
	//
	// It exists because the machines already had one and nothing here knew it.
	// Every relay was given a region and a list of regions by hand, after
	// enrolment, and the enrolment went on writing neither — so a relay brought
	// up by the script fell back to the selector that picks a node at random,
	// which is the fault that put people in rooms held on machines they could
	// not reach. Recorded here, the enrolment can write both.
	Node string `json:"node,omitempty"`

	// Label is what a person is shown instead of the name.
	//
	// The name is a key: immutable, because a client that measured it will send
	// it back at the join, and short, because it is typed at a prompt on a
	// machine being brought up. Neither of those makes it good to read. "sh" is
	// a fine key and a poor thing to offer somebody choosing where to hold a
	// call, and the fix is not to rename the key — a rename orphans every client
	// that had measured the old one.
	Label string `json:"label,omitempty"`

	// Enabled is whether clients are sent here.
	//
	// The reason this is a flag rather than a deletion: taking a relay out of
	// service should stop new calls from arriving without ending the ones it is
	// already holding, and should be reversible by somebody who did not write
	// down its address first.
	Enabled bool `json:"enabled"`

	// Added is when somebody put it here, for a page that wants to say so.
	Added time.Time `json:"added"`

	// Order is where it sits in the list, smallest first.
	//
	// Set from a page rather than derived, because the useful order is not one
	// this server can work out. Alphabetical put a reserve relay above the one
	// holding every call, and by-date put whichever machine was rebuilt most
	// recently at the bottom. Whoever runs the deployment knows which relay they
	// want to look at first.
	//
	// Zero on everything written before this existed, which sorts them together
	// and leaves the name to break the tie — exactly the order they had.
	Order int `json:"order,omitempty"`

	// AdminOnly keeps a relay off the list everybody else is offered.
	//
	// For a machine that is not for general use: an expensive line, a box being
	// tried out, one paid for by somebody in particular. Distinct from Enabled,
	// which takes it out of service, and from Fallback, which is about when to
	// reach for it — this is about who may.
	//
	// Enforced where the relay is chosen and not only where the list is drawn.
	// Hiding it from the picker stops it being picked by accident; refusing it
	// at the join is what stops it being picked on purpose by somebody who read
	// the name off a colleague's screen.
	AdminOnly bool `json:"adminOnly,omitempty"`

	// Fallback keeps a relay out of the ordinary rotation without taking it out
	// of service.
	//
	// The case it exists for: a relay abroad, kept for when the domestic ones
	// cannot be reached. It works, it should be dialled when nothing else can
	// be, and it should never be the answer to "which relay is nearest" — every
	// byte of a call held there crosses a border twice and arrives late.
	//
	// Distinct from Enabled, which means the machine should take no calls at
	// all. This one means: not unless there is nothing else.
	Fallback bool `json:"fallback"`
}

// What a relay can be wrong in.
//
// Sentinels rather than sentences, because the sentence belongs to whoever is
// showing it: these travel to a management page that says them in the reader's
// own language, and an English string returned from here would arrive on screen
// untranslated. The text on each is for a log and for whoever is reading a stack
// trace, and is never what a person is shown.
