/*
Signed-in sessions, kept across a restart.

They were held in memory and nowhere else, on the reasoning that a session
should not outlive the configuration that authorised it. That was true when the
administrators were a section of a configuration file and changing them meant a
restart. It stopped being true when the list moved into the store: signing
somebody out now happens by removing them, which takes effect on the next
request, and a restart no longer changes who may be here.

What the old behaviour actually did was sign everybody out whenever the process
was upgraded — which, during an afternoon of deployments, is every few minutes,
and reads as the sign-in being broken rather than as the server having been
restarted.

The token is not stored. What is stored is its SHA-256, so a copy of this file
is not a set of working credentials: an attacker who reads it holds the hash of a
cookie somebody has, which is worth nothing without the cookie. The comparison is
by lookup rather than by scan, which is constant-time in the useful sense — the
work does not depend on how close a wrong token was to a right one.
