A note about where a room is has to stop being believed.

It is written after a join so the next person lands where the meeting already
is, which saves them a measurement and is what lets somebody into a relay
reserved for the administrator who invited them. Left to itself it never
expired, and that turns a hint into a permanent binding: every room returns to
whichever relay it first landed on, for good, and choosing a server stops
meaning anything the second time a name is used.

There is no cheap way to ask whether anybody is still in the room — the media
server knows and asking it is a request to every relay on every join — so the
note ages out instead. Being wrong either way is survivable: too eager and
somebody is forwarded by the media server with only a measurement wasted, too
patient and a meeting that ended hours ago sends the next one back to a machine
it need not use. Lasting forever is the only outcome that is not.
