/*
 * That a refused join reaches the screen somebody pressed.
 *
 * The waiting room is two halves. The server turns a stranger away with
 * `not_invited`, and the join screen answers that one refusal by offering to
 * knock on the door — every other failure is only reported. The half that
 * decides which is which is a `catch` in App, and it swallowed the rejection:
 * it said what went wrong, then returned normally, so the screen saw a join
 * that had worked and drew nothing to press.
 *
 * Nothing failed. The message was correct, the button came back, and the door
 * was simply never offered. It survived a typecheck, a unit run and a review,
 * and was found by two browsers a week later.
 *
 * So the guard is here rather than in PreJoin's own tests: PreJoin was right
 * the whole time, and testing it again would have gone green on the broken
 * build. What has to hold is that the rejection crosses the seam between the
 * two, which is the thing nothing was watching.
