/*
 * Three ways the schedule card was quietly wrong.
 *
 * It let a time through that had already gone. Whether the chosen time was in
 * the past was worked out when the card last drew itself, and the button used
 * that answer; a form left open across the chosen minute sent a meeting for a
 * moment that had passed, and the server's hour of grace let it in.
 *
 * It could not tell "nothing arranged" from "could not ask". The list was read
 * once and a failure was swallowed, so a person whose request failed saw the
 * same empty card as one who had never arranged anything, with nothing to
 * press.
 *
 * And it could report a meeting as failed that had been made. The link was
 * copied inside the same try as the arranging, so a browser with no clipboard
 * threw after the meeting existed, and the catch said the arranging had gone
 * wrong. The meeting was there, the person was told it was not, and the
 * natural next move was to make it again.
