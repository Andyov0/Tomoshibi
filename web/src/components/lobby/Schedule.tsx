/**
 * Arranging a meeting, from the lobby.
 *
 * A card that opens. Closed it is one line, like the two forms above it; open
 * it is the whole question — which name, which day, what time, which machine —
 * laid out with room to answer each. The first version put all of it on one
 * row beside a native date field, and on a screen wide enough for the lobby
 * the name field was squeezed to the width of a cursor while the date field
 * read "dd/mm/yyyy, --:-- --". It looked like a form somebody had given up on.
 *
 * ## Why the picker is drawn here
 *
 * The rule in this codebase is to prefer the platform's control over one of
 * its own, and the date field is the exception that proves it. The platform's
 * control for a date and a time is the one thing in the browser that looks
 * different on every browser and good on none of them, cannot be styled, and
 * asks for a year and a month for a meeting that is next Tuesday. What is
 * needed is smaller than what it offers: a day in the next sixty, and a time
 * to the quarter hour. That is a grid and two lists, and both are drawn with
 * the same pieces the rest of the lobby is drawn with.
 *
 * The hour and the minute stay platform selects. A list of twenty-four is a
 * list, and the platform draws lists well.
