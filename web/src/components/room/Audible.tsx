/**
 * Everything the room sounds like.
 *
 * Voices are not part of the layout, so nothing on screen renders them, and
 * without this the call is silent while every other sign of life — the tally,
 * the microphone icon, the level on somebody's own meter — says it is working.
 * That is the worst shape a fault can take, so the sound gets its own component
 * rather than being tucked inside a tile that might not be on the page.
 *
 * The renderer is the library's own: it follows microphones and shared system
 * audio, skips the local participant so nobody hears themselves, and keeps
 * playing while the speaker's tile is paged away or hidden behind a share. It is
 * left with no volume of its own, because the one it takes is applied to every
 * track at once and would overwrite the settings below on every render.
 *
 * Passed the room directly rather than through a provider, which is what makes
 * it usable here at all — this application holds its room itself and puts no
 * context above the tree.
