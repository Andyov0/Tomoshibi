 * browser's own audio pipeline, which every other call app relies on when it is
 * not shipping a model of its own. They are not exposed as switches because the
 * defaults are right for a meeting, and the one case where they are wrong
 * (playing music) is better served by sharing a tab with its audio.
 *
 * Where sound comes out is here too, and was not. Somebody who plugs in
 * headphones part-way through a call had no way to move the call onto them from
 * inside the application: the only route was to leave, change the machine's
 * setting, and come back. Offered only where the browser can act on it — Safari
 * cannot, and a control that silently does nothing is worse than its absence.
