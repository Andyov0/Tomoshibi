/**
 * Shown to somebody who is alone.
 *
 * The moment anybody most needs the link to a room is the moment they discover
 * they are the only one in it, and until now that moment offered a view of
 * themselves and nothing else.
 *
 * The button and nothing else. It said so in a sentence first, which was a
 * caption on a fact the screen was already making plain — one picture, and it is
 * yours. What somebody wants at that moment is the address, and a button that
 * names what it does needs no line above it explaining the room.
 *
 * It goes when a second person arrives, which is not when the address stops
 * being wanted: the room's own menu carries it from then on.
 *
 * ## What it offers, which is not always the address
 *
 * The address is only a way in where anybody may use a room that exists. Where
 * the door asks for an invitation — which is this deployment — copying it and
 * sending it to somebody invites them to be turned away, and the person doing
 * the sending has no way to know that. It is the worst version of this screen:
 * the one moment somebody is actively trying to get another person into the
 * room, answered with a button that cannot.
 *
 * So under that door it mints an invitation instead, which is the thing that
 * works, and offers it only to whoever runs the room, because the server will
 * refuse anybody else. Somebody alone in a room they do not run is told who can
 * let people in rather than handed a button that answers 403.
