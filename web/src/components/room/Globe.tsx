Where the servers are, as a globe you can turn.

The list they replaced answered "which of these is quickest" well and "where are
these" not at all — eleven rows of text with a flag on each, and the flag is the
only thing on the row that says anything about the world. Somebody choosing where
to hold a call with people in three countries is thinking about the world.

Hand-drawn rather than a mapping library, and the coastlines are a fourteen
kilobyte file in this repository. A globe is a circle, an orthographic
projection, and some lines: the projection is nine lines of arithmetic, and every
library that would do it arrives with a tile loader, a layer system and several
hundred kilobytes of things this does not need.

The sphere is the point. A flat map puts Los Angeles and Shanghai at opposite
edges when they are neighbours across the Pacific, which is exactly the
relationship somebody is trying to see. Turning it is how you look at the other
side, and it starts turned to wherever the fastest relay is, because that is the
side the person looking is on.
