/**

 * deliberately less than what the management pages can do. Those belong to
 * whoever runs the deployment and reach every room on every relay; this belongs
 * to whoever opened this one and reaches nobody outside it.
 *
 * Quietening somebody is done at the server rather than by asking them, because
 * the case it exists for is a microphone left open in a noisy room by somebody
 * who is not reading the chat. Handing the room over is here because the person
 * who opened a recurring meeting is often not the person running it, and because
 * they leave — a room whose host has gone is a room nobody can quiet.
 *
 * Removing somebody does not stop them coming back. Saying so on the button
 * would be noise; not knowing it would be worse, so it is said once, under the
 * list, where somebody about to use it will read it.
