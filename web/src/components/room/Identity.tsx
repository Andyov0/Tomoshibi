/**
 * Who somebody is, as one control.
 *
 * A name and the passphrase that proves it were two fields, one above the other,
 * which said they were two decisions. They are not: the passphrase is the whole
 * of what makes the name anybody's, and it is worth nothing on its own. So they
 * are one bordered field with a hairline through it, and the ring on focus
 * belongs to the pair rather than to whichever half is being typed in.
 *
 * The name takes the wider share because it is read as letters and the
 * passphrase is read as dots.
 *
 * Two bare inputs rather than the shared field component, which brings a border
 * and a ring of its own: here the container owns both, and a field inside a
 * field is a box drawn twice.
