/**
 * Whether the microphone is picking anything up, before anybody is in a call.
 *
 * The join screen shows the camera and asked nothing about the microphone, and
 * its own comment says the page exists to answer two questions: whether the
 * camera is pointing at the right thing and whether the microphone is the right
 * one. It could only answer the first. Somebody with the wrong input selected,
 * a muted headset, or a device the browser has decided is a webcam's microphone
 * in another room found out by joining a meeting and being asked whether they
 * were there.
 *
 * A meter rather than a number. What somebody wants to know is "does it move
 * when I speak", which a bar answers instantly and a decibel figure does not.
 *
 * It opens its own stream and closes it, rather than borrowing the one the call
 * will use. Borrowing would mean holding a microphone open across the join,
 * and the track handed to the room is made there with the constraints the room
 * wants; two claims on one device is how a browser ends up handing over silence.
