/**
 * What can be done to one picture, on the gesture that has always meant that.
 *
 * Everything here is reachable some other way, and that is the point rather than
 * a redundancy to trim. Putting a picture on the stage is a click and filling the
 * screen with it is a double click — one of those is discoverable and the other
 * is not, and a gesture nobody finds is a feature nobody has. A menu says the
 * names out loud.
 *
 * The exception is the sound, which lives in a panel because sound carries on for
 * people the layout is not drawing. This is the shortcut for the person somebody
 * is looking straight at, writing to the same record; the panel is still where
 * the ones on the second page are reached.

			 * defaulted, so the outer trigger declines the second one on its
			 * way past. A long press has no such chain. It opens from a timer
