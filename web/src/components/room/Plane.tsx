/**
 * The one place a picture is ever rendered.
 *
 * Every participant's tile is mounted here for as long as they are in the room,
 * whatever the arrangement is doing. Where a tile sits, how large it is, and
 * whether it is on screen at all are read from the plan and applied as style —
 * so changing the arrangement moves elements rather than replacing them.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole reason this exists. A video element that
 * unmounts drops its subscription with it, and a subscription that has to be
 * made again stops the stream, starts it, and waits for a keyframe before
 * anything is visible. Putting somebody on the stage used to cost exactly that:
 * a black picture, for as long as the keyframe took.
 *
 * Whoever the plan leaves out is not removed. It is moved out of sight, which
 * costs nothing worth saving — an element out of the viewport does not
 * intersect it, and a track nobody is looking at is dropped by the subscription
 * that follows visibility.
