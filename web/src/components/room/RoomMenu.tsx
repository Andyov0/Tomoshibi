 * that repeats a visible button is a longer menu that says nothing new.
 *
 * The link is the exception. There is an invitation on screen while somebody is
 * alone in a room, which is the moment they most need one — and it goes the
 * instant a second person arrives, which is not the moment they stop needing it.
 * Somebody waiting for a third had nowhere to get the address back except the
 * browser's own bar, where it is a room name buried in a fragment.
