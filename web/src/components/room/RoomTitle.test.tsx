 * What the screen before a call says about the name in it.

 * On most deployments, nothing worth saying: the name arrives generated, anybody
 * who has it can join, and a paragraph about that under every room would only
 * teach people to stop reading paragraphs.
 *
 * Where new rooms are an administrator's to open, the same field means something
 * else entirely — it is no longer a name to keep or replace but one to be given
 * — and somebody who is not told that presses Join, is refused, and has no way
 * to tell whether they were kept out or simply mistyped. So the line has to be
 * there before the press, and it has to be the only line: two sentences under a
 * text field are one sentence read.
