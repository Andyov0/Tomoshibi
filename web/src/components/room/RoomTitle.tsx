 * name is the only thing that makes the screen mean anything — it is where the
 * call is, it is what somebody was sent, and it is the credential — so it is
 * given the size of the thing it is instead of the size of a caption.
 *
 * In the monospace this interface keeps for anything a machine produced, beside
 * the timestamps and the signatures. Nobody chose these letters and reading them
 * to somebody over a telephone is what they are for.
 *
 * One control still does the work of two: it arrives holding a generated name,
 * which is a new meeting, and typing over it is joining somebody else's.

 * `fixed` is somebody holding an invitation. The room was decided by whoever
 * sent it and the link is what admits them, so renaming it is not a choice they
 * have: it walks them to a different room with a key for this one, and the
 * server refuses. PreJoin's own documentation says the passphrase field goes for
 * a guest "and so does the ability to rename the room out from under the
 * invitation" — only the first half was ever written.
