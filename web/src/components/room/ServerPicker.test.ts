/**
 * What this guards is a menu that looks right on the deployment it was written
 * for and comes apart on the next one.
 *
 * Grouping is built from a free text field an operator types. That field can be
 * empty, can be one level deep or two, can repeat, and can change halfway down
 * the list — and every one of those has a correct rendering that is not obvious
 * from the code. A heading printed once per relay instead of once per run, or a
 * relay indented under a group it does not belong to, is the kind of fault that
 * is only visible with the right list in front of you.
