 * "Hong Kong" tell somebody nothing about which will carry their voice better,
 * and the one piece of information that would — how long a packet takes to get
 * there and back — is something this page can measure in a second and is
 * already measuring in order to choose automatically. Withholding it and then
 * asking the person to decide is asking them to guess at the answer it has.
 *
 * So the numbers are here, and they arrive as they are measured rather than all
 * at once: a relay that is down should not hold up the three that answered
 * immediately, and watching them land one at a time is also the clearest
 * possible statement that they are being measured now rather than remembered.
 *
 * Built rather than a native select, and not for the look. A native option can
 * hold one line of text and no marks: no colour for how good a number is, no
 * second line, nothing that arrives after the menu is open. All three are the
 * whole point here.
