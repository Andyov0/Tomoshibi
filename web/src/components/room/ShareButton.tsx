/**
 * Starting and stopping a screen share.
 *
 * The choice of what the screen is for lives inside this button rather than
 * beside it. As a control of its own it was a bare pair of numbers sitting among
 * the microphone and the camera, and it could not answer either of the two
 * questions anybody would ask of it: whose setting is this, and which picture
 * does it govern. Nothing about a capsule reading "30 | 60" says screen, and
 * nothing says sending.
 *
 * Placed here, both answers are structural rather than written down. It is under
 * the screen button, so it is about the screen; it is on the controls for one's
 * own devices, so it is about what is being sent. Neither fact needs a label,
 * and a label would not have made them true.
 *
 * It also puts the question where the answer is known. Asked in advance it is a
 * setting to remember and get wrong later; asked at the moment of sharing, it is
 * the same question as which window to share, and somebody about to share a
 * terminal knows they are about to share a terminal.
