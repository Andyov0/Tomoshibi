/**
 * How the call is going, in the corner.
 *
 * Two readings of the same thing, and which one somebody wants depends entirely
 * on why they looked. Most of the time the question is "is it me?", and the
 * answer is a colour and a number: bars and a round trip, small enough to
 * ignore. Occasionally the question is "what exactly is wrong?", and then
 * nothing short of the figures will do.
 *
 * So it is one control with two sizes rather than two features. Pressing it
 * opens the detail, and the choice is remembered — somebody who wants the
 * numbers usually wants them in every call, and somebody who does not never
 * wants to be asked again.
 *
 * Deliberately not a warning. It does not appear when things go wrong and
 * disappear when they are fine, because a light that only shows up in trouble
 * is one nobody can find when they need it, and its absence gets read as
 * "nothing is being measured" rather than "everything is well".
