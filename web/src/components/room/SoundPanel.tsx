/**
 * How loud everybody else is.
 *
 * A list of what can be heard, which is deliberately not a list of what can be
 * seen. Sound in this application is rendered outside the stage on purpose —
 * what somebody can hear must not depend on what the layout happens to be
 * drawing — so the person who is too loud is as likely as not to be on the
 * second page, behind a share, or nowhere on screen at all. A control living on
 * a tile could not reach them.
 *
 * One row per thing there is to hear rather than one per person, because a
 * shared screen has a sound of its own and it is a different sound: a film
 * somebody is playing and the voice describing it arrive on separate tracks and
 * are turned down separately. That the two are separate needs no explaining
 * here — it is two rows, and the layout has been showing them as two pictures
 * all along.
