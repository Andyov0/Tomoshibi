 * the door is watched from the room rather than from the panel: the menu is a
 * dropdown, so anything living inside it exists only while it is open. A
 * preference read there would be read once, when somebody happened to look.
 *
 * What this has to survive is a camera going off and coming back on, and a
 * different camera being chosen. Both replace the track, and a processor is a
 * property of a track — so the blur somebody turned on before the call would
 * quietly stop applying at the first device change, which is the failure this
 * watches for. The publication is re-read on every local track change and the
 * choice is applied again.

	 * The result was not an error. The call went on and the person's own picture
	 * became two pixels across, which reads as a black tile, and turning blur off
	 * again left it there.
	 *
	 * It cannot happen in development, which is why it shipped: the first blur
	 * fetches two and a half megabytes of runtime and model, instant off
	 * localhost and seconds over a network, so the window only exists on a real
	 * deployment. A ref rather than state because the effect must see the change
	 * without being restarted by it, which is the whole shape of the fault.

			 * The guard is held across the camera going off and dropped before it
			 * comes back, which is not fussiness. Dropped any earlier, the effect
			 * — already re-running because the choice changed — takes hold of the
			 * track that is being torn down and installs on that. It fails, the
			 * failure puts the switch back to off, and blur reads as a control
