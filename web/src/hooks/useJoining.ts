 * handing them a door they cannot open — and the button that offers to do it
 * reads as an invitation, which is the one thing it is not.
 *
 * Cached in a promise rather than re-fetched per component, because the answer
 * is a property of the deployment and three requests for it on one screen is
 * three chances to draw two different things.
 *
 * Undefined until it is known. Nothing decides anything on a guess here: a
 * button drawn and then taken away is worse than one that arrives a moment
 * late, and this one is about who can be let into a meeting.
