/**
 * Blurring whatever is behind somebody.
 *
 * A person joining from a kitchen, a bedroom or an office with other people's
 * screens in it is choosing between showing that and turning the camera off,
 * and most of them turn the camera off. That is the whole reason this exists.
 *
 * ## Where the model comes from, which is the entire difficulty
 *
 * Segmentation is MediaPipe's, run through livekit's track processors. Left
 * alone that package fetches two things at runtime: its WebAssembly runtime
 * from jsdelivr and the model from Google's storage. Neither host answers from
 * mainland China, which is where most of the people using this deployment are,
 * so the ordinary integration is one that works everywhere it was tested and
 * nowhere it is used — and fails as a spinner rather than as an error, because
 * a fetch that never completes is not a fetch that failed.
 *
 * So both are served from this deployment, out of `web/public/segment`, and
 * `assetPaths` below is what points at them. They are committed rather than
 * downloaded during the build for the same reason: a build that reaches those
 * hosts is a build that cannot be run from the machines this is developed on.
 *
 * The runtime is nine megabytes and is stored compressed, at about two. See
 * `internal/app/web.go` — the server serves `.br` under the real name, which
 * exists for this file.
 *
 * ### Refreshing them
 *
 * The runtime has to match the version `@livekit/track-processors` imports,
 * and `segment.test.ts` fails if the two drift. To bring them forward:
 *
 * ```
 * pnpm add -D @mediapipe/tasks-vision@<the pinned version>
 * cp node_modules/@mediapipe/tasks-vision/wasm/vision_wasm_internal.js public/segment/
 * brotli -q 11 -o public/segment/vision_wasm_internal.wasm.br \
 *   node_modules/@mediapipe/tasks-vision/wasm/vision_wasm_internal.wasm
 * pnpm remove @mediapipe/tasks-vision
 * ```
 *
 * It is removed again afterwards because nothing in this source imports it —
 * the package is track-processors' own dependency, and declaring it here would
 * be a line in the manifest that no import justifies.
 *
 * Only the SIMD build is kept. MediaPipe asks for a `nosimd` one where the
 * browser has no WebAssembly SIMD, which no browser that can hold a video call
 * has lacked since 2021; shipping a second nine-megabyte runtime for that case
 * is nine megabytes copied to every relay for nobody.

 * Fetch the runtime and the model before anybody asks for them.
 *
 * Installing a processor whose runtime is still arriving, in a call that is
 * already running, produces a canvas track that never draws a frame — the
 * install reports success, the picture goes to nothing, and turning blur off
 * again does not bring it back. It is a timing fault and nothing else: the same
 * browser, the same room and the same code work when the files are already in
 * its cache and fail when they are not, which is why it never appeared in
 * development and appeared every time on a deployment.
 *
 * So the wait is moved off the switch. This is called when a call starts, costs
 * one fetch of the same bytes somebody would have paid for on their first press,
 * and leaves the press itself instant.
 *
 * Failures are ignored on purpose. This is a head start, not a requirement; the
 * check in blur below is what makes a cold install safe.
