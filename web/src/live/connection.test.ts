 * What these guard is a light that says the wrong thing.
 *
 * A connection light is only useful if it can be trusted at a glance, and the
 * way it stops being trustworthy is by being kind. Three green bars on a call
 * that is breaking up does more harm than no light at all: it sends somebody
 * looking at their microphone, their browser, and their colleague before they
 * think to doubt the indicator.
 *
 * So the bands are asserted at their edges, and so is the rule that the server's
 * own verdict can only ever make the reading worse. The server sees this
 * participant from the far side; where it is unhappy and the local numbers are
 * not, the numbers are the ones missing something.

/*
 * What the share row says about why it is held back, sample after sample.
 *
 * The browser reports a reason on every outbound-rtp entry: "cpu",
 * "bandwidth", "other", or "none". The row carried the last reason forward
 * whenever a sample had no reason to give, which was meant for a sample taken
 * while the encoder was reconfiguring — and it treated "none" as no reason to
 * give. So a share held back by the CPU for ten seconds went on saying so for
 * the rest of the call, and the person reading it moved to a nearer machine
 * or closed their browser tabs for a fault that had already gone.
 *
 * Tested through the hook with a fake room handing out reports in sequence,
 * because the fault was in the merge and not in the function that reads the
 * string.
