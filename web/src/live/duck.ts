/**
 * Music that makes way for speech.
 *
 * Whenever anybody in the call is talking -- this person included -- the
 * song desk's music is turned down where it is heard, and brought back up a
 * moment after they stop: what a radio presenter's desk does under a voice,
 * and what a pair of earphones that notice their wearer talking does to what
 * is playing. Each browser decides for itself, from the microphones it can
 * hear, and turns down only its own playback, so what goes out is still the
 * file sample for sample and nobody's choice reaches anybody else.
 *
 * Only microphones are listened to. The music, a screen's sound and anything
 * else are not speech, and the music counted as speech would turn itself down
 * for as long as it played. What is not avoided here is the music reaching a
 * microphone through somebody's speakers: the browser's echo cancelling takes
 * most of it out, and the threshold is set above what is left, but a loud room
 * with no headphones can still sound like somebody talking. That is what the
 * switch is for.
 *
 * Music also arrives gently: a stream that starts is faded in over a second
 * and a half rather than starting at full level in the middle of a sentence.
