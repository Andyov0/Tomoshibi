 * and that is not a preference. Both of the library's own places forget:
 *
 *   - a volume lives in `RemoteParticipant.volumeMap`, and every remote
 *     participant is torn down and rebuilt on a full reconnect;
 *   - a block lives in `RemoteTrackPublication.requestedDisabled`, and a
 *     publication does not outlive the track it describes, so somebody stopping
 *     a share and starting it again comes back audible.
 *
 * Neither failure announces itself. The call carries on, the setting is simply
 * not there any more, and the person who set it finds out by hearing something
 * they had decided not to hear. So this is the record, and what the library
 * holds is treated as a cache of it that is re-filled whenever the room changes
