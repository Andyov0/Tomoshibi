/*
What the person running a meeting can do about it.

The powers are ordinary and the authorisation is the interesting part. There are
no sessions for people in a call — a join is stateless and deliberately so — and
sending a passphrase back with every mute would put a credential on the wire for
each press. The token this server signed is the answer: it names one room and one
identity, it cannot be edited, and the server that verifies it is the server that
signed it. So it goes in an Authorization header and nothing here has to hold
anything secret of its own.

None of this is deployment moderation, which lives behind the management pages
and can close any room on any relay. This is the smaller thing every meeting
needs: quiet a microphone somebody left open, remove somebody who will not leave,
and hand the room on when you go.
