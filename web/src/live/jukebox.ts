/**
 * The song desk: a queue the whole call can add to, played into the call by
 * one person's browser.
 *
 * Somebody who can reach the music library runs it -- holds the queue, fetches
 * and plays each track, losslessly, through the same output a single track
 * plays through -- and everybody else sees what is playing and what is next,
 * and adds to it: a track they found, a keyword the desk searches for them, a
 * playlist or song link as it was shared. A song ends and the next one plays on
 * the same stream where it can; anybody may vote to skip, and a majority of the
 * others listening skips it. The model is the Chinese "song request desk" the
 * open-source Jusic made familiar, kept to what a call needs.
 *
 * Everything travels as data, so in an encrypted call -- where this project's
 * SDK options do not encrypt data -- the desk runs for its holder alone and says
 * nothing to the room: what is being listened to is not something the relay is
 * told in a call whose promise is that it hears nothing.
