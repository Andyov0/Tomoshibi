 * pictures stretch, which is what a plain CSS grid does. It produces tall thin
 * cells for two people on a wide screen, and a 16:9 picture in one of those is
 * mostly cropped away. What people expect instead, and what every meeting
 * application does, is pictures that keep their shape and sit centred with space
 * around them.
 *
 * So the arrangement is chosen rather than derived: every column count is tried
 * and the one giving each person the most space wins.
