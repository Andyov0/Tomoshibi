/*
 * Hearing a lossless share.
 *
 * Two promises are tested here, and each fails quietly if broken. The first is
 * that what reaches the player is exactly what was sent, in order. The second is
 * that whenever the lossless stream is not playing -- it never started, it
 * stopped, a packet went missing, the player could not start -- the Opus track
 * comes back. Holding Opus back is what keeps one song from playing twice; if
 * it is held back with nothing playing in its place, the listener hears
 * silence and nothing on the screen says why.
