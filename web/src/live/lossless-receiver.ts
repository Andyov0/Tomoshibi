/**
 * Hearing somebody's shared sound without loss.
 *
 * For each person whose sound share is offered losslessly (its Opus track is
 * named LOSSLESS), this browser asks for the stream, plays it through its own
 * audio context, and holds the Opus track back at the media server so the same
 * song is not downloaded twice or heard twice a second apart. holdsBack is how
 * the code that applies volumes and blocks (Audible.tsx) learns which Opus
 * tracks to leave off.
 *
 * It is lossless or it is nothing. A stream that has not started STALL_MS after
 * asking, has stopped for that long, or has a packet missing from its sequence
 * is given up on for the rest of that share, and the Opus track comes back. A
 * missing packet should not happen -- the channel is reliable and the media
 * server, as this deployment configures it, never drops from it -- but if one
 * does, twenty milliseconds of the song have gone, and carrying on would be
 * presenting a stream with a hole in it as the lossless one.
 *
 * Not offered in an encrypted call. The SDK encrypts media tracks there and,
 * with the options this project uses, not data packets, so the lossless stream
 * would cross the relay as plain samples in a call whose whole promise is that
 * the relay cannot hear it. The sharer's side never offers it in one either;
 * this side checks as well, because it is the side whose sound it would be.
