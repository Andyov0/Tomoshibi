/**
 * Sending shared sound without loss, alongside the Opus track that carries it
 * for everybody else.
 *
 * The samples are read off the captured track as the browser delivered them,
 * before any encoder has seen them, in blocks of FRAMES; each block is coded by
 * lossless.ts and sent over the reliable data channel to the people who asked
 * for it, and to nobody else. Asking is what keeps this from costing anything
 * where it is not used: a browser on an older version of the page, or one whose
 * owner has turned this person down, never asks, and the media server is never
 * handed a packet for it. An ask lasts ASK_LASTS and is repeated every
 * ASK_EVERY, so a listener who vanishes without a word stops being sent to
 * shortly after.
 *
 * The samples come from a MediaStreamTrackProcessor, which hands over each
 * chunk of capture exactly as the browser has it. It holds up to a second of
 * capture while the page is busy, so a stall on this thread is a delay rather
 * than a hole; a hole would still be noticed, by the timestamps, and counted.
