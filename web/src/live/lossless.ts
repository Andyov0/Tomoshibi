/**
 * Sound carried without loss: the format.
 *
 * Every codec a browser will put on an audio track is a lossy one. Opus is very
 * good at sounding like the original, and at its ceiling nobody hears the
 * difference, but it is a model of what a listener will notice, and what it
 * sends is its own reconstruction. Somebody who asked for the sound they are
 * sharing to arrive as it left -- a lossless file playing at one end, the same
 * samples at the other -- cannot be given that on a media track at all. So the
 * samples go another way: as data, over the call's reliable data channel, which
 * retransmits until everything has arrived and delivers it in order. Nothing is
 * dropped, nothing is concealed, and what is played at the far end is, sample
 * for sample, what was captured here.
 *
 * This file is the part both ends agree on: the packet and the coding inside
 * it. It is the same idea as FLAC -- a fixed polynomial predictor chosen per
 * block, stereo optionally coded as mid and side, the prediction error written
 * in Rice codes with a parameter per partition and a verbatim escape -- written
 * out here rather than taken from a library, because the whole of it is a few
 * hundred lines, it has to be exactly invertible, and that is easier to know of
 * code that is short enough to read.
 *
 * Samples are 24-bit integers. The browser hands over 32-bit floats, whose
 * significand is 24 bits; for anything that came from a 16- or 24-bit source,
 * which is every file and every sound card, the conversion is exact. Going to
 * 16 bits would have rounded away the bottom byte of a 24-bit file, and keeping
 * the floats as they are would have cost a third more for bits no source has.

 * on exactly -1 and 1. Found by printing what decodeAudioData made of a 16-bit
 * FLAC whose every sample was known: -24849 came back as -24849/32768 and 6827
 * as 6827/32767. Nothing is lost -- each integer still has its own float -- but
 * toInt24, which assumes one scale for both signs, moves every positive sample
 * a little, and three samples in four of a stereo file were reported changed.
 *
 * So for a 16-bit file the integer is recovered with the scale Chrome used for
 * its sign, and sent as the file's own sample shifted up eight bits.
 *
 * A 24-bit file needs nothing of the kind, and this says so rather than doing
 * something: Chrome decodes it through 32-bit integers, where the two scales
 * differ by one part in two thousand million, which moves a 24-bit sample by
 * less than a two-hundred-and-fifty-sixth of a step -- rounding takes it back
 * to the file's integer every time. A special case was written for it first,
 * and breaking it changed no result; the test that would have caught it now
 * holds toInt24 to every 24-bit value instead.
 *
 * Anything else -- a lossy file, captured sound -- was never integers, and
