/**
 * Meetings arranged ahead of time.
 *
 * The server file carries the argument for what one is; this is the client's
 * side of the door. Two people use it: a host arranging one from the lobby and
 * being handed the link, and a person who opened that link — possibly hours
 * early — asking whether it has begun.
 *
 * ## The token in the link
 *
 * The link is `?meeting=<token>#/<room>`. The token is a bearer secret for a
 * day's entry once the meeting begins, so it is treated the way `?invite=` is:
 * read once, kept for this tab, and taken out of the address bar — people share
 * their screens in calls, and the address bar is on the screen.
 *
 * ## The room is what the server says
 *
 * The hash names a room and so does the meeting record, and only the second is
 * trusted: the hash can be edited by hand, and the invitation this turns into
 * is good for the arranged room and no other.
