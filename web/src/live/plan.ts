 * between them replaced one tree with the other, so React destroyed every video
 * element and built new ones — and a video element that unmounts takes its
 * subscription with it. Putting somebody on the stage therefore stopped their
 * stream, started it again, and waited for a keyframe before anything appeared.
 * That wait is the black screen.
 *
 * Positions do not have that problem. Every picture is rendered once, in one
 * place, for as long as its owner is in the room; what changes is where it is
 * and how large. Nothing unmounts, so nothing unsubscribes, and moving to the
 * stage becomes an animation rather than an interruption.
 *
 * The geometry lives here, apart from React, because it is arithmetic and
 * arithmetic can be checked.
