 * What these guard is a control that lied.
 *
 * The interface offered thirty frames a second or sixty, and the browser was
 * duly asked to capture whichever was chosen — but the encoder had a ceiling of
 * its own, fixed at thirty, and half of every sixty-frame capture was thrown
 * away before it left the machine. Choosing the second option cost twice the
 * capture work to send precisely what the first one sent, and nothing anywhere
 * said so.
 *
 * A fault of that shape cannot be seen from either end. The capture is genuinely
 * running at sixty, the picture genuinely arrives, and only a number buried in a
 * publication says the two do not meet. So the meeting point is what is asserted
 * here, rather than any of the things that looked fine while it was broken.
