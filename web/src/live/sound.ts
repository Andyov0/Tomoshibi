 * for people who can hear the difference. A microphone went out at 48 kbit/s
 * mono with DTX, which stops sending in a pause and so clips the first syllable
 * after one; the browser was asked for automatic gain, noise suppression and
 * voice isolation, each of which reshapes a voice before it is encoded; and the
 * sound of a shared screen went out the same way as a voice, folded to mono,
 * gated and run through the same processing. Music came out of that as a
 * telephone recording of a radio.
 *
 * Three profiles now, chosen by what is being sent rather than by a single
 * default that has to be wrong for two of them.
