/**
 * How the server is doing, and how it got here.
 *
 * The plot is the point. A single reading says whether the link is busy now; an
 * hour of them says whether the evening was climbing, and whether the
 * retransmissions underneath began before or after it did — which is the
 * difference between somebody's connection and this one running out. Six months
 * of them answers the question a single evening cannot: whether this is what
 * the link has always done.
 *
 * How far back to look is a choice rather than a constant, because the spans
 * are not variations on one question. Ten minutes is somebody watching a call
 * go wrong; a month is somebody deciding whether to pay for more bandwidth.
 *
 * The live reading is polled a floor above and handed down, because it also
 * belongs in the rail, where it is legible from every other panel. The trend is
 * polled here, because it is only ever looked at here.
