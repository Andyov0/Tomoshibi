/*
 * What this guards is a button that asks a question about the wrong machines.
 *
 * The measurement on every row is taken while the list is drawn, so re-reading
 * the list refreshes all of them — which made re-reading the list a plausible
 * implementation of the button on one row, and it was the one this page had.
 * It is not visibly wrong: the row does update, with a true reading, and the
 * only witnesses are a fleet dialled eleven times over for one answer and a
 * spinner that keeps turning until the slowest machine in the deployment
 * replies. On a fleet where something is genuinely down that is the full
 * timeout on every press, and the row it appears to be about is a relay that is
 * perfectly well.
 *
 * Nothing about that fails a type check or throws, which is why the count of
 * calls is what is asserted here rather than what ends up on screen.
