 * An answer belongs to the question it was asked about.
 *
 * The question here is rebuilt on every render, so it is held in a ref and
 * changing it deliberately does not restart the timer — otherwise a caller who
 * forgot to memoise would send a request per render. The cost of that is what
 * this is about: when the subject changed, the answer already on screen stayed
 * there until the next tick, and it was not a stale answer to this question but
 * a correct answer to a different one.
 *
 * Clicking a second room showed the first room's people, and its history — and
 * the history is polled every twenty seconds, which is long enough to read,
 * believe and act on.
