/*
The two screens in front of a call, on a deployment that does not let strangers
open rooms.

The page used to put somebody straight into a room with a generated name, which
is the right thing when anybody may start one: the fastest path to a meeting is
to already be in it. It is the wrong thing when they may not, because then the
first thing that happens is a refusal, and it arrives after they have chosen a
camera and typed a name.

So where opening a room is restricted, the order inverts: say who you are, then
say what you want. Two choices rather than a form, because they are genuinely
different errands — starting a meeting is a decision, joining one is following an
instruction somebody else gave you — and a single box asking for a room name
serves the second and quietly fails the first.

Neither screen appears on a deployment that lets anyone open a room. There the
old page is right and this would be a door in front of an open gate.

Both are one card on an empty screen, which is a harder thing to make look
deliberate than a busy one: there is nothing else to be in proportion to. So the
ground carries a single warm glow behind the card, everything arrives in an
order, and the corner holds only what somebody might actually want from a page
they are passing through.
*/

/**
 * The shell both screens sit in.
 *
 * A grid rather than nested flex boxes, and centred by the grid rather than by
 * the child: the header is placed in its own row instead of being a sibling the
 * content has to make room for, so the card is centred in the window and not in
 * whatever is left over below the header. That distinction is invisible until
 * the header grows a second control, at which point everything below it slides.
 */
/**
 * How much of the fleet is answering, beside the name of the thing.
 *
 * A relay that has stopped answering is invisible from here — the picker simply
 * does not offer it, and a call still happens on one of the others — which is
 * the right behaviour and a poor way to find out. This is where somebody who
 * runs the deployment learns that two of eleven machines are down, at the moment
 * they are looking at the page anyway rather than the week the bill arrives.
 *
 * Both numbers, because either alone says nothing: three answering is excellent
 * out of three and alarming out of eleven. The light is read first and the
 * numbers second, so it carries the judgement — everything answering is one
 * colour, some of it answering is another, and none of it is the third.
